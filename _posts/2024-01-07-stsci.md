This page is essentially a summary of the [poster](https://aas243-aas.ipostersessions.com/Default.aspx?s=2A-E3-38-C1-E9-54-BF-E7-B6-08-1F-0F-71-07-CC-C1) that I presented in January 2024 at the American Astronomical Society conference. It encompasses the evolution of wavelength calibration for the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), a spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. Any object that absorbs or emits light can be studied with a spectrograph to determine important characteristics such as temperature, density, chemical composition, and velocity. For more, visit [this page](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/observatory/design/cosmic-origins-spectrograph/) which provides more depth into the instrument and its capabilities. Our work involved developing a new, automated, and more reliable way of calibrating the instrument for best use of wavelength readout as the instrument begins to degrade.

### The CalCOS WAVECORR Algorithm

Prior to our work, wavelength calibration ("wavecal") shifts for spectra observed by COS are found using a $$ \chi^2 $$ fitting method that matches an observed spectrum to a template spectrum. This is done by determining the location of the wavecal spectrum on the detector relative to the template, and then applying zero point shifts to align the wavecal and the template. However, this method is not ideal for observing modes in wihch the calibratoin spectra are faint due to sensitivity loss, resulting in shifts that are reported as unreliable by the calibration pipeline; shifts that are found must exceed an arbitrary cutoff threshold or they will be reported as unreliable. Therefore, there is a need to develop a more versatile method of finding these calibration shifts for both the near- and far-ultraviolet detectors (NUV/FUV).
