The goals of this manufacturing project were to define product specifications using CAD software, outline component requirements by developing manufacturing process plans, gain experience with simple machine shop machines (lathe, mill, drill press, etc), manage internal and external resources, and build and test the final design. The project also highlights the important differences between design for manufacturability (DFM) and design for assembly (DFA). DFM focuses on making individual parts easy and cost-effective to manufacture while DFA focuses on minimizing the time, cost, and errors involved in assembling those parts into a finished product. There are several tradeoffs that were observed between DFM and DFA, trying to bring a CAD model to life, and through understanding the practical capabilities of the available machines.

### Design

Each component was designed and modeled in SOLIDWORKS to visualize a baseline assembly. This version featured 10 player models and had dimensions 12.5 x 19.75 inches.

This assembly was helpful in streamlining the manufacturing process plans for the key components, but it is not representative of the final product for several reasons. During the manufacturing phase, back walls were designed and manufactured to create a space to collect the ball once a goal has been scored; bushings were selected to allow near-frictionless movement of the rods through the through holes in the side walls; player heads were 3D printed in two different colors to distinguish between teams; handles were manufactured and attached to the rods for comfortable control of players; and bumpers were added to rods with 2 players to prevent unwanted contact with the side walls.
