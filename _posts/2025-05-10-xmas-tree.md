This project presents the development of an IoT-enabled Christmas tree featuring dynamic lighting and motion responsive to sensor data and user control. A Raspberry Pi manages a WS2811 RGB LED strip, BH1750 ambient light sensor, motion sensors, and servo-driven animatronic eyes with custom 3D-printed housing. Python libraries including rpi_ws281x and Flask were used for real-time LED control and web-based customization. A six-layer IoT model guided the system architecture, combining perception, data processing, actuation, networking, and user interfacing. 3D spatial mapping of the LEDs enabled complex, geometry-based animations, while real-time ambient brightness was visualized through a web dashboard.

### Methods

Regarding setup and LED handling, a 2-foot Christmas tree was purchased along with a strip of 50 WS2811 programmable LEDs. Additionally, an independent 5 V power supply was purchased with a DC adapter that wires directly to the LED strip via WAGO connectors. The LEDs were positioned uniformly throughout the tree for the best visual experience; due to the circuitry of the LED strip, the LEDs light up in the order they are wired when they are sequentially programmed. To achieve a broader spectrum of animations (especially those based on geometry), 3D coordinates were collected for each LED. By using a 360-degree protractor and a tape measure, polar cooridnates were collected and then converted to Cartesian coordinates for use in generating complex light patterns. 

The I2C BH1750 light sensor was chosen to detect changes in ambient brightness in tandem with the lighting setup. Regardless of LED effects, this sensor dims or amplifies brightness based on ambient light. The ambient light (and subsequent LED brightness) is published on the user interface so that peak usage times can be estimated for a continuously lit tree and energy consumption can be decreased where appropriate.

    Once the tree was set up, polar coordinates were utilized to generate 50 3D coordinates (X,Y,Z) of each LED for geometry-based animations. The microcomputer also used ambient light readings delivered by the BH1750 sensor to control brightness of the LEDs.

### Results

For animating the lights, several mathematical- and time-based effects were brainstormed including fireworks, twisters, heartbeats, contagious (proximity-based) effects, and random planes or rotations.

  Simple light animations (proximity-based contagious and rainbow spiral effects). Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You" was also synchronized to the lights, although this was done manually instead of automated.
