This project investigates system identification of a DC motor simulator using both analytical and data-driven methods. A white-box state-space model was first derived to establish the expected dynamics, step and frequency responses were measured, and then black-box methods were trained on the data to model the full electromechanical system.

### White Box Approach

An electric DC motor is connected to a wheel with linear damping $$ c $$ and inertia $$ J $$. The motor generates a torque $$ \tau $$ with some angular velocity $$ \omega $$ which is related to the back emf $$ v_{emf} $$ by the motor constant $$ K_v $$. The motor converts electrical power to mechanical power with efficiency $$ \eta $$, with the equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\omega = K_v v_{emf} \quad\quad\quad \eta = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Using the efficiency equation with mechanical and electrical power, the relation between current $$ i_m $$ and torque $$ \tau $$ is given by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{out}&=\eta P_{in}\\
\tau \omega &= \eta i_m v_{emf}\\
\tau K_v v_{emf} &= \eta i_m v_{emf}\\
\frac{K_v}{\eta} \tau &= i_m
\end{aligned}
$$

Applying Newton's law of rotation to the system, the mechanical equation of motion is $$ J \dot{\omega} = \tau - c \omega $$.

Applying Kirchoff's current and voltage laws with the current $$ i_m $$, the electrical equation of motion is $$ v_{in} = v_{emf} + R_m i_m $$.

Combining both equations of motion with the given relations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
J\dot{\omega}&=\frac{\eta}{K_v}i_m-c\omega\\
J\dot{\omega}&=\frac{\eta}{R_mK_v}(v-v_{emf})-c\omega\\
J\dot{\omega}&=\frac{\eta}{R_mK_v}(v_{in}-\frac{\omega}{K_v})-c\omega\\
J\dot{\omega}&=\frac{\eta}{R_mK_v}v_{in}-(c+\frac{\eta}{R_mK_v^2})\omega
\end{aligned}
$$

In state-space form, the system is represented by:

$$
\dot{x}=\begin{bmatrix}\dot{\omega}\\\dot{\theta}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{-\eta}{JR_mK_v^2}-\frac{c}{J}&0\\1&0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\omega\\\theta\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}\frac{\eta}{JR_mK_v}\\0\end{bmatrix}v_{in}=Ax+Bu
$$

Using these matrices, the analytical solution $$ x(t) $$ given an input $$ u(t) $$ is formulated as:

$$
x(t)=e^{At}x_0+\int_0^t e^{A(t-\tau)}Bu(\tau)d\tau
$$

For the next analyses, parameters are chosen. The resistance of the motor coil is $$ R_m = 2 \Omega $$, the moment of inertia of the wheel is $$ J = 0.004 kgm^2 $$, the linear damping coefficient of the wheel is $$ c = 0.015 \frac{Ns}{mrad} $$, the motor constant is $$ K_v = 100 \frac{rad}{sV} $$, and the efficiency is $$ \eta = 0.9 $$. 

With the chosen parameters, the analytical solution $$ x(t) $$ is illustrated for a unit step input ($$ u(\tau)=v_{in}(t)=1 $$) and five randomized initial conditions near zero, showing how each state $$ \omega(t) $$ and $$ \theta(t) $$ respond to such an input.

Finally, the poles of the system are analyzed, which dictate the stability and how a response may oscillate and settle over time. THe poles are the eigenvalues of the state matrix A:

$$
A=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{-\eta}{JR_mK_v^2}-\frac{c}{J}&0\\1&0\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}-3.7388&0\\1&0\end{bmatrix}
$$

The characteristic equation is $$ \Delta(s) = s(s+3.7388) $$ thus the system has 2 poles, one at 0 and one at -3.7388.

### Step Response

In this section, motor velocity $$ \omega(t) $$ step responses from the motor plant simulator will be normalized and singular value decomposition (SVD) will be used to estimate the nonzero pole $$ a $$. The first order dynamics of the system can be modeled by a pole at $$ a $$ and a DC gain $$ K_{DC} $$, which is estimated from the final value of a response once the system has settled to a stable state. With zero initial conditions, these dynamics can be expressed as

$$
\dot{x}=ax+\frac{K_{DC}}{a}v_{in}
$$

the $$ k $$ step response to which is $$ x(t) = kK_{DC}(1-e^{at}). With simulated data allowing nonzero initial conditions, however, the first-order step response becomes $$ x(t) = kK_{DC}+(x_0-kK_{DC})e^{at}. The normalization is thus:

$$
\hat{x}(t)=1-\frac{x(t)-x_0}{kK_{DC}-x_0}=e^{at}
$$

This normalization allows for the estimation of $$ a $$ through the SVD least squares fit of $$ \ln \hat{x}(t) = at $$.

For 50 velocity simulations, the normalized responses are shown. Initial conditions for $$ \omega(0) $$ were randomized in "[-6,6]" rad/s and $$ \theta(0) $$ in "[-0.5,0.5]" rad. The step magnitude $$ k $$ was randomly chosen in "[1,12]" V. The DC gain $$ K_{DC} $$ was estimated using the final 10 percent of each response.

These simulations returned an average pole of $$ m_a = -3.50 $$ with standard deviation $$ \sigma_a=1.00 $$ using a fine mesh of $$ \delta t = 0.001 $$ over a 3 second period. With the noise and nonlinearities included in the simulator, the pole falls within the expected range of values predicted by the white box approach. Using a more coarse time interval leads to high-variance least squares results, most likely due to the noise present.

### Frequency Response

In this section, a sinusoidal input is used to determine the frequency response of the system. An input $$ u(t) = A\sin(\omega t) $$ results in a response of the form $$ x(t) = GA\sin(\omega t + \phi) $$ with a gain $$ G $$ and phase shift $$ \phi $$ which are found using a gradient descent method. Gradient descent methods update the desired parameters by means of predefined loss functions, which are used here to fit sine waves to the motor plant output at different frequencies, and to fit the first order Bode plot. To mirror data sampled from the step response simulations, the sinusoidal input is forced to be positive in the range "[0,12]" V using $$ u(t) = V_{bias} + A\sin(\omega t) $$ where $$ V_{bias} = 6 $$ and $$ A \in (0,6] $$.

To fit the sinusoidal response, the motor plant output is assumed to take the form $$ y(t) \approx a\sin(\omega t) + b\cos(\omega t) $$ and the model is initialized as $$ \hat{y}(t) = a\sin(\omega t) + b\cos(\omega t) $$. The residual error is $$ e(t) = \hat{y}(t)-y(t) $$. The mean squared error loss function is then defined as:

$$
J(a,b) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N [e(t_i)^2]^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N [a\sin(\omega t_i) + b\cos(\omega t_i) - y(t_i)]^2
$$

with updates $$ a \leftarrow a - lr \frac{\partial{J}}{\partial{a}} $$ and $$ b \leftarrow b -lr\frac{\partial{J}{\partial{b}} $$ where $$ lr $$ is the learning rate. 

These updates allow for the amplitude, gain, and phase to be computed as $$ A = \sqrt{a^2+b^2} $$, $$ G = 20\log_{10}(A) $$, and $$ \phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) respectively. A similar approach is used to fit the Bode plots from the simulated data. The transfer function for a first order Bode plot assumes the model $$ G(s) = \frac{K}{1+s\tau} $$. Additionally, the following equations are used to simplify the gain magnitude $$ M(\omega) $$ and phase $$ \phi(\omega) $$ in terms of the relevant parameters $$ K $$ and $$ \tau $$:

$$
M(\omega)=20\log_{10}|G(i\omega)|=20\log_{10}K-10\log_{10}(1+\omega^2\tau^2) \quad\quad\quad \phi(\omega)=\angle G(i\omega)=-\tan^{-1} (\omega \tau) \frac{180}{\pi}
$$

The desired parameters $$ \theta $$, in the logarithmic space, are thus the DC gain and the time constant: $$ \theta = \begin{bmatrix}\logK&\log\tau\end{bmatrix}^T $$. The magnitude and phase errors are defined as $$ e_m(\omega)=M_{model}(\omega)-M_{data}(\omega) $$ and $$ e_p(\omega) = \phi_{model}(\omega)-\phi_{data}(\omega) respectively. The loss function is defined as:

$$
J(\theta)=\sum_{i=1}^N [e_m(\omega_i)^2+e_p(\omega_i)^2]
$$
