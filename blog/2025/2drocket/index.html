Therefore, in the rocket body fixed frame, the thrust vector can be expressed as \(f_t' = \rho\begin{bmatrix}\sin\phi&amp;\cos\phi\end{bmatrix}^T\). To convert between the body fixed frame and the global frame, a rotation matrix is used with the thrust term in the first equation of motion:</p> \[\begin{aligned} m\ddot{p}&amp;=f_g+\rho\begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta^-\sin\theta\\\sin\theta&amp;\cos\theta\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\sin\phi\\\cos\phi\end{bmatrix}\\[4pt] &amp;= f_g + \rho\begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta\sin\phi-\sin\theta\cos\phi\\\sin\theta\sin\phi+\cos\theta\cos\phi\end{bmatrix} \\[4pt] &amp;= f_g + \rho\begin{bmatrix}\sin(\phi-\theta)\\\cos(\phi-\theta)\end{bmatrix} \end{aligned}\] <p>In the global frame, the gravitational force is constant with \(g\) as the acceleration due to gravity: \(f_g = \begin{bmatrix}0&amp;-mg\end{bmatrix}^T\).</p> <p>In the body fixed frame, the position of the thruster \(r\) is constant assuming the body fixed y-axis points forward. Thus, \(r = \begin{bmatrix}0&amp;-d\end{bmatrix}^T\) and the second equation of motion can be rewritten as:</p> \[J\ddot{\theta}=\rho d \sin\phi\] <p>which is combined with the previous derivations to get the complete set of second order nonlinear dynamics:</p> \[\begin{aligned} m\ddot{p}_x&amp;=\rho \sin(\phi-\theta)\\ m\ddot{p}_y&amp;=\rho \cos(\phi-\theta)-mg\\ J\ddot{\theta}&amp;=\rho d \sin\phi \end{aligned}\] <hr> <h4 id="linearization">Linearization</h4> <p>The states of the system are \(x = \begin{bmatrix}p_x&amp;p_y&amp;\theta&amp;v_x&amp;v_y&amp;\omega\end{bmatrix}^T\) where \(v_x\), \(v_y\), and \(\omega\) are the time derivatives of \(p_x\), \(p_y\), and \(\theta\) respectively and the input is \(u = \begin{bmatrix}\rho&amp;\phi\end{bmatrix}^T\). To determine the inputs and states \((x^*,u^*)\) such that the rocket hovers at some arbitrary point \(p_0 = \begin{bmatrix}p_{x0}&amp;p_{y0}\end{bmatrix}^T\), the following must be true:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \ddot{p}_x&amp;=\ddot{p}_y=\ddot{\theta}=0\\ \dot{p}_x&amp;=\dot{p}_y=\dot{\theta}=0\\ p_x^*&amp;=p_{x0}\\ p_y^*&amp;=p_{y0} \end{aligned}\] <p>The equations of motion become:</p> \[\begin{aligned} 0&amp;=\rho^* \sin(\phi^*-\theta^*)\\ 0&amp;=\rho^* \cos(\phi^*-\theta^*)-mg\\ 0&amp;=\rho^* d \sin\phi^* \end{aligned}\] <p>With \(\rho &gt; 0\), these equations imply \(\sin(\phi^*-\theta^*) = 0\), \(\sin \phi^*=0\), and \(\rho^*\cos(\phi^*-\theta^*)=mg\). To guarantee the physically relevant solution with upward thrust, \(\phi^* = 0\), \(\theta^* = 0\), and \(\rho^* = mg\). Therefore, the equilibrium state and input for hovering at an arbitrary point \(p_0\) are:</p> \[\begin{aligned} x^*&amp;=\begin{bmatrix}p_{x0}&amp;p_{y0}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\end{bmatrix}^T\\ u^*&amp;=\begin{bmatrix}\rho^*\\\phi^*\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}mg\\0\end{bmatrix} \end{aligned}\] <p>Next, the state space is linearized about the equilibrium by</p> \[\Delta \dot{x} = A \Delta x + B \Delta u\] <p>where $\Delta x = x - x^*$ and $\Delta u = u - u^*$. To compute the Jacobians,</p> \[A = \left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right|_{(x^*,u^*)} \qquad \text{and} \qquad B = \left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\right|_{(x^*,u^*)}\] <p>the full state dynamics are needed:</p> \[\dot{x}=f(x,u)=\begin{bmatrix}\dot{p}_x\\\dot{p}_y\\\dot{\theta}\\\dot{v}_x\\\dot{v}_y\\\dot{\omega}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}v_x\\v_y\\\omega\\\frac{\rho}{m}\sin(\phi-\theta)\\\frac{\rho}{m}\cos(\phi-\theta)-g\\\frac{\rho d}{J}\sin\phi\end{bmatrix}\] <p>With \(A_{ij} = \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}\) and \(B_{ik} = \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial u_k}\) for each state and input, and with values \(m = 20\) kg, \(J = 4\) kgm^2, and \(d = 0.75\) m, the full state matrices are:</p> \[A = \begin{bmatrix}0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\\0&amp;0&amp;-g&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\end{bmatrix} \quad\quad\quad B = \begin{bmatrix}0&amp;0\\0&amp;0\\0&amp;0\\0&amp;g\\\frac{1}{20}&amp;0\\0&amp;\frac{15g}{4}\end{bmatrix}\] <p>The matrix \(A\) does not depend on the model parameters, and it is observed that the eigenvalues of \(A\) are:</p> \[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 =\quad...\quad= \lambda_6 = 0\] <p>With all eigenvalues lying at the origin, the stability of the equilibrium is not asymptotically stable by definition. Because the eigenvalue at 0 has nontrivial Jordan blocks, the equilibrium is also not Lyapunov stable. Therefore the equilibrium is unstable in the open loop. The open-loop response of the rocket is compared near the equilibrium for both the linearized model and the full nonlinear model. The initial conditions consist of a small perturbation in pitch angle \(\theta\) and no control input is applied \((u=0)\).</p> <p>img</p> <p>The position \(p_x\) drifts rapidly in both simulations. Because the rocket is tilted to start, the thrust vector has a constant horizontal component which causes \(p_x\) to grow unbounded in both models. This demonstrates the open-loop instability of the hover equilibrium. The main discrepancy in the two simulations appears in the vertical position \(p_y\). In the linearized dynamics \(p_y\) remains constant since the linearization assumes small angles and treats the thrust as fully canceling gravity. In the nonlinear model, however, the vertical thrust component is \(mg\cos\theta_0&lt;mg\) for some initial pitch \(\theta_0\), so the vertical position gradually descends due to a force imbalance.</p> <hr> <h3 id="control-system-design">Control System Design</h3> <p>With a complete formulation of both the nonlinear dynamics and the linearized version, controllability and observability may be explored in the following control system designs. Later, the full controller-observer design will be utilized for certain demonstration scenarios.</p> <hr> <h4 id="controllability">Controllability</h4> <p>To prove that the linearized system is controllable, the controllability matrix is computed. However, it is noted that the matrix \(A\) is nilpotent of order 4 \((A^4 = 0)\). Thus, only the first four blocks of the controllability matrix are required:</p> \[\begin{aligned} C&amp;=\begin{bmatrix}B&amp;AB&amp;A^2B&amp;A^3B\end{bmatrix}\\[4pt] &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;g&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\frac{-15g^2}{4}\\0&amp;0&amp;\frac{1}{20}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\frac{15g}{4}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;g&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\frac{-15g^2}{4}&amp;0&amp;0\\\frac{1}{20}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;\frac{15g}{4}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\end{bmatrix} \end{aligned}\] <p>The matrices \(A\) and \(C\) share the same rank of 6, and thus the pair \((A,B)\) is controllable.</p> <p>To demonstrate controllability, a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller will be developed to hover the rocket. This approach is chosen over closed-loop pole placement because the large dimension of the state space (6 states) would require a lot of manual tuning with several trials. Since the system is multi-input and strongly coupled, the LQR provides a more systematic tuning framework by enabling the tradeoff between balancing position, attitude, and control effort. The LQR controller minimizes the quadratic cost</p> \[J=\int_0^\infty(\Delta x^TQ \Delta x + \Delta u^TR \Delta u)dt\] <p>with weighting matrices \(Q\) and \(R\) which reflect the importance of different states in hover. The position errors were given moderately high weights to ensure that the rocket returns to the hover point, whereas the pitch angle and rate were weighted more heavily because attitude errors quickly lead to extreme position drifts. Control effort weighting in the \(R\) matrix was chosen to balance stability with actuator usage. The LQR problem was then solved using the continuous-time algebraic Riccati equation</p> \[A^TP+PA-PBR^{-1}B^TP+Q=0\] <p>to solve for \(P\), which is then used to compute the optimal feedback gain: \(K = R^{-1}B^TP\). With this formulation, the resulting LQR gain matrix is:</p> \[K = \begin{bmatrix}0&amp;10&amp;0&amp;0&amp;20.25&amp;0\\-10&amp;0&amp;55.25&amp;-11.07&amp;0&amp;13.13\end{bmatrix}\] <p>The resulting eigenvalues of the closed-loop system \((A-BK)\) are \(\lambda = -369.17, -2.42, -1.39 \pm 1.45i, -0.51 \pm 0.49i\), and asymptotic stability is guaranteed due to all real parts being negative.</p> <p>Below, the closed-loop response of the linearized and nonlinear rocket dynamics are compared under the LQR controller, using an initial condition that includes significant horizontal and vertical displacement and a \(25 \deg\) pitch error. As shown, in both simulations the controller sucecssfully stabilizes the rocket and drives states back to the hover equilibrium.</p> <p>img</p> <p>The linearized model shows a smooth response in all states, as expected, and the nonlinear system exhibits a similar qualitative behavior but with noticeable deviations in transient response. The nonlinear \(p_x\) and \(p_y\) trajectories show overshoot and a slower return to equilibrium due to the nonlinear thrust coupling terms. Overall, the comparison demonstrates that the LQR-stabilized linear model predicts the behavior of the nonlinear system, performance degrades under large disturbances, and the closed-loop equilibrium is asymptotically stable.</p> <hr> <h4 id="observability">Observability</h4> <p>For observation purposes, it is assumed that there are independent sensors measuring the positions as well as the angular velocity. Therefore, in the state space formulation, the following \(C\) matrix is established:</p> \[C = \begin{bmatrix}1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\end{bmatrix}\] <p>The linearized system is proven to be observable by computing the observability matrix. For the same reason as the controllability matrix, the highest order computation involves \(A^3\) due to the nilpotency of \(A\).</p> \[O = \begin{bmatrix}C\\CA\\CA^2\\CA^3\end{bmatrix}\] <p>The result is a \(12 \times 6\) matrix with rank 6. Because the observability matrix shares the same rank as \(A\), the pair \((A,C)\) is observable.</p> <p>To implement the state observer on the system, a Kalman filter is developed. While pole placement methods are simple to implement, they do not explicitly describe the tradeoff between noise and responsiveness. By tuning the noise covariances \(Q_n\) and \(R_n\), real-time state estimation (sensor fusion) is provided, leading to better accuracy and robustness. First a linear state observer is introduced to estimate the full set of states using the available measurements:</p> \[\dot{\hat{x}} = A\hat{x} = Bu + L(y-C\hat{x})\] <p>where \(\hat{x}\) is the estimated state and \(L\) is the observer gain matrix. The estimation error is defined as \(e = x - \hat{x}\) which elads to the error dynamics \(\dot{e} = (A-LC)e\). The Kalman filter determines \(L\) by assuming the system is subject to stochastic disturbances:</p> \[\dot{x}=Ax+w \quad\quad\quad y=Cx+v\] <p>where \(w\) is a process noise with covariance \(Q_n\) and \(v\) is a measurement noise with covariance \(R_n\). The goal is to find the gain \(L\) that minimizes the steady-state estimation error \(\mathbb{E}[ee^T]\). First, the optimal estimation error covariance matrix \(P\) is solved from the continuous-time algebraic Riccati equation:</p> \[AP+PA^T-PC^TR_n^{-1}CP+Q_n=0\] <p>Given \(P\), the Kalman gain is then computed as:</p> \[L=PC^TR_n^{-1}\] <p>The closed-loop state observer performances are shown below, showing both the true and estimated states. Among the measured states, \(\omega\) exhibits a short transient in the estimate because the Kalman filter blends prediction and sensor data according to the Kalman gain, resulting in a brief but stable correction phase.</p> <p>img</p> <p>Next, the LQR controller code is modified to utilize the estimated states as feedback for both the linearized and nonlinear systems. The closed-loop response of the two systems under combined LQG control are compared, using estimated states obtained from the Kalman observer. It is shown that both systems converge, but not identically, which is expected due to the nonlinear couplings in the true dynamics.</p> <p>img</p> <p>In both cases, the system converges to the hover equilibrium, confirming stability of the augmented plant-observer model. The nonlinear system exhibits larger transient errors due to thrust nonlinearities and saturation but preserves the qualitative behavior predicted by the linear model. Further, the eigenvalues of the closed-loop observer \(A-LC\) are \(\lambda = -1.15 \pm 1.44i, -1.29, -3.15, -1.27 \pm 1.25i\), which convey asymptotic stability due to all of the real parts being negative. The tracking patterns for the trajectories are shown below. In both systems, estimated states converge rapidly to the true states, confirming observability and stability. As expected, there is a larger transient error for \(\theta\) since it is not directly measured; the fact that \(\theta\) still converges cleanly demonstrates the proper Kalman gain tuning.</p> <p>img</p> <hr> <h3 id="demonstrations">Demonstrations</h3> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Now that the controller and observer have been designed separately and now combined, it will be demonstrated for different trajectory scenarios. For the following demonstrations, it is assumed that the rocket has two limitations on the input: \(0 \le \rho \le 400\) N and $$</td> <td>\phi</td> <td>\le \frac{\pi}{4} $$. The controller configuration will be tested and modified for a landing maneuver as well as a waypoint-based flight.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <hr> <h4 id="landing">Landing</h4> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Landing is a different maneuver from hovering because it introduces three main challenges that the LQG controller alone cannot handle: the input constraints given above, the power of gravity and free flal, and the final state requirements ( \(p_x=p_y=0\) m and $$</td> <td>v_y</td> <td>\le 0.2 \(m/s). In initial simulations, the original controller would fail to combat the free fall dynamics especially with the high-velocity initial condition used for the first state:\) x = \begin{bmatrix}20&amp;5&amp;\frac{-\pi}{20}&amp;-1&amp;-10&amp;0\end{bmatrix} $$.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>The landing controller presented here extends the baseline LQG regulator by embedding it within a supervisory guidance and safety framework. The augmented state consists of the true state \(x\), the estimated state \(\hat{x}\) produced by the Kalman filter, and a dynamically evolving reference state \(x_{ref}\) generated by guidance logic. The guidance logic reasons to establish target states based on three main regimes: emergency, braking, and controlled descent. The emergency phase is governed by physics-aware safety in terms of the energy and force balances:</p> \[d_{stop}=\frac{v_y^2}{2a_{max}} \quad\quad\quad a_{max}=\frac{\rho_{max}}{m}-g\] <p>Once emergency braking is not required, the braking phase determines targets for vertical velocity by holding altitude and driving \(v_y\) towards zero, which fixes crash behaviors originally reported in simulations. Lastly, the controlled descent phase defines fast descent with high altitude, slow descent near the ground, and an interpolation in between. These governing regimes allow the LQG controller to stabilize and track the references, resulting in a robust landing behavior under the linearized dynamics.</p> <p>img</p> <p>In the linearized case, the trajectory forms a broad, smooth arc that includes substantial lateral motion after initial vertical braking, allowing the spacecraft to translate horizontally while descending and ultimately return toward the landing pad. In contrast, the nonlinear trajectory lands close to its initial horizontal position, failing to translate towards the pad. This indicates that under the nonlinear dynamics and input constraints, the available thrust is primarily allocated to vertical braking instead of horizontal repositioning. The velocity profiles compare the velocity responses; in both cases, the controllers successfully combat the large initial downward velocity.</p> <p>img</p> <p>For the linearized system, the velocity components both converge to a satisfactory touchdown state that reflects the expected trajectory. The velocity profile of the nonlinear system confirms that the controller’s thrust allocation is dominateed by vertical braking, leaving insufficient lateral motion to produce horizontal translation before touchdown.</p> <hr> <h4 id="waypoint-flying">Waypoint Flying</h4> <p>The next demonstration is a flight starting on the launchpad (0,0) with 3 sequential waypoints: (0,20), (-10,20), and (10,20). The vehicle will then return to the launchpad at the origin after the final waypoint.</p> <p>This maneuver builds directly on the original LQG controller by extending it from a single equilibrium regulation problem to a multi-point trajecotry execution problem while remaining within the same control framework. The primarily design challenge here is not safety or feasibility, but rather smoothly transitioning between multiple spatial objectives without destabilizing the closed-loop system. Each waypoint defines a target that the reference state \(x_{ref}\) approaches according to the first-order dynamics. Once the vehicle enters a small tolerance around a waypoint, an event is triggered and the next waypoint becomes active, creating a piecewise-continuous trajectory through the environment.</p> <p>The position trajectories for both the linearized and nonlinear models are presented below. In both cases, the vehicle successfully visits the sequence of waypoints, demonstrating that the controller and reference governor together produce smooth trajectories across multiple position objectives. The trajectories show smooth transitions with no abrupt changes in direction or oscillatory behavior, indicating that the reference dynamics effectively limit the rate at which new commands are introduced.</p> <p>img</p> <p>For the linearized model, the trajectory follows straight-line segments between waypoints which is consistent with the assumptions where thrust vectoring and attitude coupling produce predictable lateral movements near each hover. The nonlinear model exhibits a similar structure but deviates slightly especially during horizontal motion at higher altitude. The trajectory shows a shallow dip in altitude while translating laterally, reflecting the fact that in the full dynamics, lateral acceleration requires tilting which temporarily reduces the vertical component of thrust. This difference is further explained by the velocity profiles for each model below. Despite this, the system remains stable and converges to each waypoint, highlighting the robustness of the controller.</p> <p>img</p> <hr> <h3 id="nonlinear-methods">Nonlinear Methods</h3> <p>Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) was selected over sliding mdoe control (SMC) and model reference adaptive control (MRAC) in this section because it addresses the dominant challenges of this rocket problem: strong nonlinear coupling, actuator constraints, and objective-based path planning. While SMC offers robustness, it is difficult to guarantee the reachability conditions required for the sliding variables. MRAC, although effective in some cases, is poorly suited for systems with underactuation and explicit input constraints and thus does not naturally accommodate all trajectory objectives. In constrast, NMPC incorporates the full dynamics and actuator limits into an optimization framework, enabling stable behavior without additional logic.</p> <p>The landing maneuver combines rapid deceleration, precise position tracking, and strict velocity limits at touchdown and thus the problem is ill-conditioned for the controllers explored here. As a result, the nonlinear methods will be presented on versions of the hover and waypoint problems previously explored.</p> <hr> <h4 id="formulation">Formulation</h4> <p>NMPC optimizes future behavior directly, making it well-suited for constrained regulation tasks such as hovering and waypoint flight. With the full set of dynamics, the NMPC framework here solves a finite-horizon optimization problem at each sampling instant \(t_k\) of the form:</p> \[\min_{u_i} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \left [(x_i-x_{ref})^T Q (x_i-x_{ref}) + u_i^T R u_i \right ] + (x_N-x_{ref})^T P (x_N-x_{ref})\] <p>subject to:</p> \[\begin{aligned} x_{i+1}&amp;=f(x_i,u_i)\\ \rho_{min}&amp;\le\rho_i\le\rho_{max}\\ |\phi_i|&amp;\le\phi_{max}\\ x_0&amp;=x(t_k) \end{aligned}\] <p>where \(f\) denotes the full set of nonlinear dynamics, \(N\) is the prediction horizon, \(Q\) penalizes state error, \(R\) penalizes control effort, \(P\) is a terminal cost, and \(x_{ref}\) is the desired reference state based on the scenario.</p> <hr> <h4 id="hovering">Hovering</h4> <p>For hovering, the reference state is fixed as:</p> \[x_{ref}=\begin{bmatrix}p_x^*&amp;p_y^*&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\end{bmatrix}^T\] <p>As a demonstration, the state is initialized as \(x_0 = \begin{bmatrix}1.5&amp;10&amp;0.1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\end{bmatrix}^T\) and control is applied so that the final state reaches and hovers at \(p_x = 0\) and \(p_y = 10\). The resulting trajectory is shown below. The rocket begins at the desired hover height but with a lateral position error and a small attitude offset. To reduce \(p_x\), the controller must tilt the thrust vector which reduces the vertical component of thrust and introduces a deviation in \(p_y\). This behavior is a direct consequence of the underactuated dynamics. Thus, horizontal corrections are prioritized while the altitude is allowed to deviate slightly in order to remain dynamically feasible and consistent with the input constraints. As the lateral error approaches zero, the thrust vector is restored to a near-vertical alignment and the trajectory effectively becomes vertical.</p> <p>img</p> <p>The position component profiles below reemphassize the tradeoff that the NMPC balances during the trajectory. The velocity profiles also complement this interpretation, as a spike in \(v_x\) corresponds to the aggressive lateral correction while \(v_y\) exhibits a behavior associated with the temporary altitude loss. The small oscillations of \(v_x\) after the \(p_x\) correction are bounded and vanish quickly, reflecting the horizon optimization tolerances rather than instability.</p> <p>img</p> <hr> <h4 id="waypoint-based-flight">Waypoint-Based Flight</h4> <p>For waypoint flight, \(x_{ref}\) is updated based on a current waypoint:</p> \[x_{ref}=\begin{bmatrix}p_{x,wp}&amp;p_{y,wp}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\end{bmatrix}^T\] <p>The demonstration is designed around the waypoints \(p_0=[0,10]\), \(p_1=[-6,10]\), \(p_2=[6,10]\), and \(p_3=[0,10]\) in successive order. The figure below illustrates the subsequent position trajectory as it executes this sequence of waypoints. Similar to the hovering demonstration, the curved and asymmetric path segments arise from the coupled and underactuated nature of the dynamics. The controller allows small deviations in altitude while accelerating laterally, then corrects the vertical error as the vehicle approaches each waypoint. Because the cost function strongly regularizes thrust magnitude around the hover value and penalizes rapid changes in input, the resulting motion favors smooth arcs rather than straight-line segments that were shown before under the LQG configuration.</p> <p>img</p> <p>The corresponding position and velocity histories are also shown during the trajectory under NMPC. The horizontal position \(p_x\) exhibits clear transitions while the vertical position \(p_y\) remains tightly regulated around the hover altitude. The velocity profiles, however, provide further insight into the controller’s behavior. Peaks in \(v_x\) occur immediately after each waypoint switch as the optimizer commands aggressive lateral accelerations to reduce horizontal tracking error. Vertical velocity remains comparatively small, and notably both components converge toward zero after each waypoint is reached, indicating sucecssful stabilization and readiness for the next trajectory. Overall, these plots confirm that the NMPC controller effectively coordinates position, velocity, and attitude as it anticipates future transitions, moderates input aggressiveness, and maintains the approximate altitude requirements.</p> <p>img</p> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Dominic Savarino.
