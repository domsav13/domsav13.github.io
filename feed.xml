The project also highlights the important differences between design for manufacturability (DFM) and design for assembly (DFA). DFM focuses on making individual parts easy and cost-effective to manufacture while DFA focuses on minimizing the time, cost, and errors involved in assembling those parts into a finished product. There are several tradeoffs that were observed between DFM and DFA, trying to bring a CAD model to life, and through understanding the practical capabilities of the available machines.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/foosball-1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/foosball-1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/foosball-1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/foosball-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/foosball-2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/foosball-2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/foosball-2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/foosball-2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Final product of the mini foosball table. </div> <hr/> <h3 id="design">Design</h3> <p>Each component was designed and modeled in SOLIDWORKS to visualize a baseline assembly.

The wing is made of Aluminum 6061 (elastic modulus \(E = 70\) GPa, Poisson’s ratio \(\nu = 0.3\), and yield stress \(\sigma_y = 250\) MPa) and experiences a downward force \(P\) applied at the shear center due to a turbojet engine.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/wing-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/wing-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/wing-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/wing.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The cross-section of an Aluminum wing with a narrow cut and shear flows, with dimensions in millimeters. </div> <hr/> <h3 id="shear-flows-and-shear-center">Shear flows and shear center</h3> <p>First, the shear center of the cross-section will be calculated analytically. The shear flow definition \(q(s) = \frac{-S_y}{I_{xx}} \int_0^s ty ds\) (N/mm) is used where \(t\) is the section thickness (mm), \(S_y\) is a placeholder force located on the shear center (N), \(I_{xx}\) is the second moment of area of the section about the x-axis (\(mm^4\)), and \(s\) is the path of the shear flow. With \(r = 25\) mm and \(t = 2\) mm, \(I_{xx}\) is calculated as:</p> \[\begin{aligned} I_{xx} &amp;= \frac{(2r)^3 t}{12} + 2\left(\frac{8 r t^3}{12} + 8 r^3 t\right) + 2 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} t r^2 \cos^2\theta \, r d\theta \\[4pt] &amp;= \frac{2}{3}r^3 t + 16 r^3 t + 2 r^3 t \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \cos^2\theta \, d\theta \\[4pt] &amp;= r^3 t\left(\frac{2}{3}+16+\frac{\pi}{2}\right)=18.24r^3t \end{aligned}\] <p>with the thin-wall approximation ($t^i = 0$ for $i \ge 2$). Now the shear flow is calculated for each major part of the section.</p> <p>In wall 12, $y = s_1$:</p> \[q_{12}(s_1) = \frac{-S_y}{I_{xx}} \int_{0}^{s_1} t s_1 \, ds_1 = \frac{-S_y t}{2 I_{xx}} s_1^2\] <p>with \(q_2(s_1=r) = \frac{-S_y t}{2 I_{xx}} r^2\) at the boundary.</p> <p>In wall 23, \(y = r\):</p> \[\begin{aligned} q_{23}(s_2) &amp;= \frac{-S_y}{I_{xx}} \int_{0}^{s_2} t r \, ds_2 + q_2 \\[4pt] &amp;= \frac{-S_y}{I_{xx}} t r s_2 - \frac{S_y}{2 I_{xx}} t r^2 = \frac{-S_y}{I_{xx}} t \left(rs_2 + \frac{r^2}{2}\right) \end{aligned}\] <p>with \(q_3(s_2=8_r) = \frac{-S_y}{I_{xx}} t \left(8r^2 + \frac{r^2}{2}\right) = \frac{-17S_y t r^2}{2 I_{xx}}\) at the boundary.</p> <p>In wall 34, \(y = r \cos\theta\):</p> \[\begin{aligned} q_{34}(\theta) &amp;= \frac{-S_y}{I_{xx}} \int_{0}^{\theta} t r \cos\theta r d\theta + q_3 \\[4pt] &amp;= \frac{-S_y}{I_{xx}} t r^2 \int_{0}^{\theta} \cos\theta d\theta - \frac{17S_y}{2 I_{xx}}tr^2 \\[4pt] &amp;= \frac{-S_y}{I_{xx}} tr^2 \left(\sin\theta + \frac{17}{2}\right) \end{aligned}\] <p>Next, a sum of moments is used at the origin of the semi-circle to solve for the distance to shear center \(x_s\) using the calculated shear flows and the placeholder force \(S_y\). The shear flows \(q_{12}\), \(q_{23}\), and \(q_{34}\) all have symmetry in the section:</p> \[\begin{aligned} M_o &amp;= 0 \\ S_yx_s &amp;= -2 \left( \int_{0}^{r} q_{12} 8r ds + \int_{0}^{8r} q_{23} r ds + \int_{0}^{\pi/2} q_{34} r^2 d\theta \right) \\[4pt] S_yx_s &amp;= -2 \left(\frac{-4S_y}{3I_{xx}}tr^4 - \frac{28S_y}{I_{xx}}tr^4 - \frac{14.35S_y}{I_{xx}}tr^4 \right) \\[4pt] S_yx_s &amp;= \frac{87.37S_y}{I_{xx}}tr^4 \end{aligned}\] <p>Thus, the distance of the shear enter from the origin of the semi-circle is:</p> \[x_s = \frac{87.37}{18.24(25)^3(2)} (2)(25)^4 = 119.75 mm\] <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/shear_center-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/shear_center-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/shear_center-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/shear_center.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The 3D model of the wing with the downward force applied at the shear center. </div> <hr/> <h3 id="lowest-allowable-force-x-y-plane">Lowest allowable force (X-Y Plane)</h3> <p>With a maximum allowable yield stress of 250 MPa, the maximum Von Mises stress is determined with a safety factor of 2:</p> \[\sigma_v = \frac{\sigma_y}{N} = \frac{250}{2} = 125 MPa\] <p>By breaking this Von Mises stress into shear and bending stresses throughout the section, the lowest allowable value for the force \(P\) can be determined.

First, the force found in the previous section overshot the predicted stress of 125 MPa, yielding 152 MPa as the wing’s maximum Von Mises stress. With trial and error, a force closer to 2180 N fits the safety factor requirements, yielding around 124 MPa as the resulting maximum Von Mises stress. The scenarios are simulated using the default SOLIDWORKS mesh, a remote load at the calculated shear center, and a rigid geometry at the fixed end of the wing.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/wing-analytical-results-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/wing-analytical-results-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/wing-analytical-results-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/wing-analytical-results.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/wing-numerical-results-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/wing-numerical-results-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/wing-numerical-results-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/wing-numerical-results.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Stress analysis of the analytical (left) and numerical (right) downward forces.
